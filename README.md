CCJam 2016 is a programming competition. Search it in ComputerCraft forums. It must be coded in Lua, to be run in ComputerCraft. I can't start programming yet, but I'm looking if I can program some APIs to start working. I haven't got any ideas, so you can leave them here, in the issues section or by a PM in CC forums.
